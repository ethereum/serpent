# Introduction

Serpent is an assembly language that compiles to EVM code that is extended with various high-level features. It can be useful for writing code that requires low-level opcode manipulation as well as access to high-level primitives like the ABI.

**Being a low-level language, Serpent is NOT RECOMMENDED for building applications unless you really really know what you're doing. The creator recommends [Solidity](http://github.com/ethereum/solidity) as a default choice, LLL if you want close-to-the-metal optimizations, or [Vyper](http://github.com/ethereum/vyper) if you like its features though it is still experimental.**

# Installation:
