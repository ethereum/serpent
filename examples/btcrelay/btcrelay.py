# 1) this should only be called once and is to "store" the block

# 2) allows testing of storing arbitrary headers and verifying/relaying
# transactions, say from block 300K, instead
# of Satoshi's genesis block which have 0 transactions until much later on
#
# Since zero is the value that indicates non-existence, block _height
# and _score have to be set carefully and they have these consequences:
#
# - _height is 1 more than the typical Bitcoin
# term height/blocknumber. ie genesis has height 1 instead of 0
#
# - _score is 1 more than the cumulative "Bitcoin standard
# difficulty". eg the cumulative difficulty at the block after genesis
# is 2 (it and genesis have difficulty of 1), but this contract assigns
# a score of 3 for the block after genesis [see testStoringHeaders()]
